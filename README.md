# perm_ascii_cracker
Comparing two files for words with same ascii sum, then comparing them for being permutations. 
=======
The "main.py" takes two wordlists and checks for permutations, it compares strings in this order : ascii sum, length, characters.

It saves the result to a file matches.txt in the format of "word_from_a_wordlist:word_from_possible_permatuation_list".

'getHash.py' Is an optional script hashing entire concatenated string of words from wordlists that has its permutation in the scrambled_words file, this was a final step in the CTF challenge, but it has no purpuse anymore and it is very likely to be removed in the final version.
